Writing Chess with Pygame

Hello! This is just a small coding project that I've been working on out of personal interest. I based the initial code 
off of the checkers implementation created in this video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnd3RfeG3NM

The only library that needs to be installed is pygame (I think...) after this the program should work.

The current version is still rough (there are a few bugs that cause the game to crash, AI has to be turned on/off by commenting
out lines in main.py, etc.), but the game is playable to an extent!
